# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Target Account Monitoring Service
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a background service to periodically check for new tweets from a configured list of target accounts using the Twitter API v2.
# Details:
Create a scheduled job that runs at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes). The job will iterate through the list of target accounts for each user. It will use the `users/:id/tweets` endpoint with the `since_id` parameter to fetch only new tweets since the last check. The `newest_id` from each API response should be stored per target account to be used as the `since_id` for the next run.

# Test Strategy:
Set up a test target account and post new tweets to it. Verify that the monitoring service correctly identifies and processes only the new tweets, and correctly updates the `since_id` value in the database.
