# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Claude AI for Content Generation
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a module to communicate with the Claude AI API for generating engaging tweet content based on given prompts and themes.
# Details:
Integrate the official Anthropic Python SDK. Create a `ClaudeService` with a method like `generate_tweet(prompt, content_type)`. This method will construct a detailed prompt for the Claude API, including instructions on tone, style, and content type (e.g., thought, quote, tip). Implement robust error handling for API failures and a basic content filter to check for inappropriate generated text.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the `ClaudeService` by mocking the Anthropic SDK. Verify that prompts are constructed correctly. Perform manual tests with various prompts and themes to evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated content.
