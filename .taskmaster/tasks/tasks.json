        "description": "Establish the project's foundational backend structure using FastAPI and implement the secure OAuth 2.0 (PKCE) authentication flow to connect with the Twitter API v2.",
        "details": "Initialize a Python project with FastAPI. Set up the Git repository with a .gitignore file. Implement the necessary endpoints for the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow: one to generate the authorization URL and redirect the user to Twitter, and a callback endpoint to handle the response, exchange the authorization code for an access token, and securely store it. Use a library like `requests-oauthlib` to manage the OAuth flow complexities.",
        "testStrategy": "Unit test the OAuth URL generation. Manually test the end-to-end authentication flow in a browser, ensuring tokens are received and stored correctly. Mock the Twitter API responses to test the callback handler's logic in isolation.",

        "description": "Implement a secure system for managing API keys (Twitter, Claude), user access/refresh tokens, and other application settings.",
        "details": "Use `python-dotenv` for loading environment variables in local development. For production, rely on environment variables injected by the deployment environment. Store user-specific tokens (access and refresh) in a PostgreSQL database. Encrypt these tokens at the application level using a library like `cryptography` before database insertion. Implement a service to automatically refresh the Twitter access token using the stored refresh token when it expires.",
        "testStrategy": "Verify that API keys are not hardcoded. Test the token encryption and decryption functions. Write a unit test for the token refresh logic, mocking an 'expired token' response from the Twitter API to ensure the refresh flow is triggered correctly.",

        "description": "Create a core service and an API endpoint to post a text-based tweet to a user's timeline using the Twitter API v2.",
        "details": "Develop a `TwitterService` class that encapsulates all interactions with the Twitter API. Use a modern Python library that supports Twitter API v2, or build a thin client using `requests`. Create a protected API endpoint (e.g., `/tweets/post`) that accepts tweet content. This endpoint should retrieve the user's stored access token, call the `TwitterService` to post the tweet, and handle any potential API errors from Twitter.",

        "details": "Integrate the official Anthropic Python SDK. Create a `ClaudeService` with a method like `generate_tweet(prompt, content_type)`. This method will construct a detailed prompt for the Claude API, including instructions on tone, style, and content type (e.g., thought, quote, tip). Implement robust error handling for API failures and a basic content filter to check for inappropriate generated text.",

        "details": "Use `APScheduler` with a `PostgreSQLJobStore` backend. This ensures that scheduled jobs persist across application restarts and deployments. Create a `SchedulerService` to abstract the scheduler's functionality, providing methods to add, remove, and update jobs dynamically based on user configuration changes received via API.",
        "testStrategy": "Unit test the `SchedulerService` to ensure jobs can be added and removed correctly. Set up a short-interval test job (e.g., every minute) that logs a message, and verify that it runs consistently after an application restart.",

        "details": "Create a scheduled job function that: 1) Fetches a user's posting configuration (schedule, themes). 2) Calls the `ClaudeService` to generate tweet content. 3) Optionally, places the content in a 'pending review' state in the database. 4) For approved/auto-post content, it calls the `TwitterService` to post the tweet. Implement a Redis-based queue (using Celery or RQ) to handle the posting action, allowing for retries on failure.",
        "testStrategy": "End-to-end test the entire pipeline: configure a schedule, wait for the job to trigger, verify the Claude API was called, and confirm the tweet appears on the test Twitter account. Test the retry mechanism by simulating a temporary failure in the Twitter API.",

        "details": "Create a scheduled job that runs at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes). The job will iterate through the list of target accounts for each user. It will use the `users/:id/tweets` endpoint with the `since_id` parameter to fetch only new tweets since the last check. The `newest_id` from each API response should be stored per target account to be used as the `since_id` for the next run.",

        "details": "Extend the `ClaudeService` with a `generate_reply` method. This method will take the target tweet's text, conversation context (if available), and a bot personality profile as input. The prompt engineering will be critical: instruct Claude to analyze sentiment, understand the context, and generate a reply that is relevant, engaging, and consistent with the defined personality.",

        "details": "When a new target tweet is identified (Task 7) and a reply is generated (Task 8), place the reply job into a delayed queue (e.g., Celery with an `eta` parameter). The delay should be a randomized value within the configured optimal window (e.g., 2-4 hours). A separate worker process will consume from this queue. Implement rate-limiting logic within the worker to respect Twitter's API limits for posting replies.",
        "testStrategy": "Verify that a generated reply is correctly added to the delayed queue with the right `eta`. Monitor the queue and confirm the worker picks up the job after the delay. Test the rate-limiting by queuing up more replies than the limit allows and ensuring the system throttles correctly without errors.",

Examples: `POST /api/v1/targets` to add a target account, `PUT /api/v1/schedule` to update the posting frequency, `GET /api/v1/config` to retrieve all settings for a user. Use Pydantic models for request validation. These endpoints will read from and write to the PostgreSQL database.",
