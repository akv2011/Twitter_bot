# Task ID: 12
# Title: Containerize Application with Docker for Deployment
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Create Docker and Docker Compose files to package the application and its dependencies for reproducible, scalable deployment.
# Details:
Write a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI application to create an optimized, production-ready image. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and orchestrate the application services: the FastAPI backend, a PostgreSQL database service (with a persistent volume), and a Redis service for caching and queueing. Include health checks for the services.

# Test Strategy:
Build the Docker images and run `docker-compose up` on a clean machine. Test the full application functionality, including database connectivity and queueing, to ensure the containerized environment works as expected. Verify that data persists in the database volume after restarting the containers.
