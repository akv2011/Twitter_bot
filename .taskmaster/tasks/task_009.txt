# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Queued Engagement and Reply System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Build the logic to post generated replies with appropriate timing delays and rate limiting to avoid spam detection.
# Details:
When a new target tweet is identified (Task 7) and a reply is generated (Task 8), place the reply job into a delayed queue (e.g., Celery with an `eta` parameter). The delay should be a randomized value within the configured optimal window (e.g., 2-4 hours). A separate worker process will consume from this queue. Implement rate-limiting logic within the worker to respect Twitter's API limits for posting replies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that a generated reply is correctly added to the delayed queue with the right `eta`. Monitor the queue and confirm the worker picks up the job after the delay. Test the rate-limiting by queuing up more replies than the limit allows and ensuring the system throttles correctly without errors.
