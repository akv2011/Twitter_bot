# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Task Scheduling System
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate a persistent scheduling library to trigger automated tasks like content posting and account monitoring based on user-defined schedules.
# Details:
Use `APScheduler` with a `PostgreSQLJobStore` backend. This ensures that scheduled jobs persist across application restarts and deployments. Create a `SchedulerService` to abstract the scheduler's functionality, providing methods to add, remove, and update jobs dynamically based on user configuration changes received via API.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the `SchedulerService` to ensure jobs can be added and removed correctly. Set up a short-interval test job (e.g., every minute) that logs a message, and verify that it runs consistently after an application restart.
