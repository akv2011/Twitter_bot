# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build Configuration Management API
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create RESTful API endpoints for clients to manage all user-configurable settings, such as schedules, target accounts, and content preferences.
# Details:
Using FastAPI, implement a full suite of authenticated CRUD endpoints. Examples: `POST /api/v1/targets` to add a target account, `PUT /api/v1/schedule` to update the posting frequency, `GET /api/v1/config` to retrieve all settings for a user. Use Pydantic models for request validation. These endpoints will read from and write to the PostgreSQL database.

# Test Strategy:
Write API tests for each endpoint using a tool like `pytest` with `httpx`. Test create, read, update, and delete operations. Test validation by sending malformed requests. Test authorization by ensuring a user cannot modify another user's settings.
